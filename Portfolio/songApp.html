        <h1><b>Song Rating App</b></h1>
        <!-- <p>
          The app allowing users to input song details such as the song name,
          singer, year of release, and their personal rating for each song. Upon
          clicking the "Insert" button, a toast message confirms the successful
          addition of the song.<br /><br />
          The app also features a "Show List" button, enabling users to view all
          the added songs in a separate activity. Within this activity, users
          have the ability to filter songs based on their ratings, specifically
          allowing them to display songs with a 5-star rating.<br /><br />
          Furthermore, the list of songs in the new activity provides
          interactive functionality. Users can click on individual songs to
          access options such as "Update" or "Delete." The "Update" option
          allows users to modify the song's details, while the "Delete" option
          removes the selected song from the list. This provides users with
          comprehensive control over the song database within the app
